# Is the World as we know it coming to an end?

Saying that it is going to end completely seems a bit extreme, however after taking a look at all the data available it's clear that a negative change is on the horizon. Using Machine Learning and Predictive Models we wanted to take a deeper dive into the data of our previous global warming project and see if the past is any indication of the future. We took a look at the monthly average temperatures from Fort Pulaski in Savannah, GA between 1979 and 2021. This graph is showing us there is a slight upwards trend in the average temperature from month to month, especially during the winter months which are plotted at the bottom of the graph.

 The number range in the data doesn't seem to be that large now, but let's keep in mind that the planet is 4.5 BILLION years old. So these lines may seem insignificant at the moment but what happens when you look at the trends for one thousand years from now, ten thousand years, a million? Rising temperatures leads to other things such as melting ice caps and rising sea levels. These things are all affected by one another in some way.  Below you can see a prediction graph of rising sea levels at Savannah, GA in just the next ten years.
